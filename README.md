## Description
Inaugural website for the small Melbourne-based food manufacturer 'Pastry Master' comprising pages for:
* Product range
* Delivery and Distribution method
* Testimonials from existing customers
* Who we are
* Contact us

Ideally, the website will also have the ability to:
* Accept online orders and payments
* Store data of users/customers and their enquiries and orders onto a database
    
## Motivation
Developing a website for the ‘Pastry Master’ business my husband and I own was the whole motivation for signing up to do the Bootcamp Coding course!
    
## Problem
Previously, the business did not have an online prescence which was causing us to miss sales opportunities and was damaging our professional credibility.

## User Story
```md
AS AN Owner/Marketing Manager of a small food manufacturing business selling pastry to other small businesses, 
I WANT a website that presents our brand in a positive & professional way,
SO THAT new & existing customers can see our product range & make contact with us digitally & we can build a database of customers.
```
